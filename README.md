# MGR-IPK-Odometer-adjustment
To read and edit the BIN file for Rover 75 &amp; MGZT IPK's, to adjust the stored odometer value

created purely via chatgpt, currently only reads/updates the diesel highline IPK. Can be read via TOAF, but will need to be written directly to the desoldered SOIC8 93S56 chip to apply changes
